👋 Hi, I’m Yassine Marroun (obito)

I’m a frontend-focused developer who cares about clarity, structure, and long-term maintainability.

I enjoy working on:

Interfaces that explain themselves

Systems that don’t fight the developer

Codebases that stay understandable as they grow

Most of my work lives at the intersection of UI, architecture, and developer experience.

🧠 What I’m Good At

Frontend

JavaScript / TypeScript

Modern UI architecture

Component-driven development

State management & data flow

Performance and rendering behavior

UI / UX Thinking

Turning vague requirements into clear interfaces

Reducing complexity instead of adding features

Designing flows that match how users actually work

Engineering Practices

Refactoring legacy code safely

Establishing conventions in messy codebases

Writing code for future readers (including myself)

Environment

Linux (Hyprland user)

Comfortable with customization, tooling, and workflows

Care about aesthetics and ergonomics

📌 Selected Projects

These projects focus on decisions and outcomes, not hype.

🧩 OpsBoard — Internal Operations Dashboard

Problem:
Operations teams relied on a slow, inconsistent dashboard that caused manual workarounds and frequent errors.

What I Did:

Reworked core flows instead of adding features

Simplified data presentation to match real tasks

Prioritized reliability and clarity over visual polish

Outcome:
Daily workflows became easier to understand and less error-prone, improving trust in the tool.

🌐 ProductSite — Public Website Redesign

Problem:
The product website failed to clearly communicate value, leading to confusion among potential users.

What I Did:

Reframed content around user questions, not marketing language

Reduced pages and components instead of expanding them

Designed structure before visuals

Outcome:
The site became easier to navigate and understand, helping users quickly decide if the product was right for them.

🛠️ CleanFront — Legacy Frontend Refactor

Problem:
A growing frontend codebase was hard to change safely and slowed down development.

What I Did:

Introduced clearer boundaries and conventions

Reduced implicit coupling between components

Focused on readability over clever abstractions

Outcome:
The codebase became easier to extend and reason about, enabling faster and safer iteration.

🧪 What I Care About (More Than Tools)

Fewer concepts, not more

Predictable systems

Honest tradeoffs

Code that explains why, not just how

I’m not interested in buzzwords or trend-chasing.
I care about work that holds up over time.
